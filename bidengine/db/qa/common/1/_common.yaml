    Hi

    I am writing you to express my interest in your posting for an experienced software developer. With a Master’s degree in Computer Science and hands-on experience in several areas of software development, I am confident that I can bring my expertise and enthusiasm to your growing development team.

    You listed requirements closely matching to my background and skillset, and I would love to highlight some of them below implying that I would be a great addition to your team.

    - Good experience in building front-end development with appealing UI/UX.
    - Professional back-end development experience.
    - Good communication and collaboration skills in the remote working environment
    - Specifically disciplined in javascript tech stacks including React.js and Node.js

    Aside from that, I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that bear charming ideas, and new technical areas.

    That’s me. I am ready to start the ball rolling. Looking forward to hearing from you very soon.

    Best Regards,
    Michael.
